My journey began in 6th or 7th grade when I installed Linux on my computer, seeking something new beyond the dull Windows environment. Since then, I've never looked back. I got into the terminal, learned Python, engaged in basic shell scripting, automated stuff, scraped websites, tweaked system services, and enjoyed breaking stuff to understand how things work. Later, I explored web development, working with various technologies, libraries, and frameworks. I learned about backend operations, databases, scalability, and real-time communications. Currently, I'm engaged in the startup world, working with cloud platforms, and doing freelancing on the side.",

        content: "As a full-stack developer, my primary focus involves handling both backend operations and user interface development. For robust tasks requiring performance and scalability, I rely on Golang, while for typical backend functionalities, I turn to NodeJS. Additionally, I use React (Next.js) for creating user interfaces, and I enhance the styling with TailwindCSS.I have several years of experience working with these technologies, as well as experience in other languages such as TypeScript, Python, C++, Elixir, and Rust, ranked in order from most to least experienced.In a nutshell, I'm all about breaking down complex tech stuff, building cool things, and having some fun along the way!"
