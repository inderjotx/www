My journey began in 6th or 7th grade when I installed Linux on my computer, seeking something new beyond the dull Windows environment. Since then, I've never looked back. I got into the terminal, learned Python, engaged in basic shell scripting, automated stuff, scraped websites, tweaked system services, and enjoyed breaking stuff to understand how things work. Later, I explored web development, working with various technologies, libraries, and frameworks. I learned about backend operations, databases, scalability, and real-time communications. Currently, I'm engaged in the startup world, working with cloud platforms, and doing freelancing on the side.",

        content: "As a full-stack developer, my primary focus involves handling both backend operations and user interface development. For robust tasks requiring performance and scalability, I rely on Golang, while for typical backend functionalities, I turn to NodeJS. Additionally, I use React (Next.js) for creating user interfaces, and I enhance the styling with TailwindCSS.I have several years of experience working with these technologies, as well as experience in other languages such as TypeScript, Python, C++, Elixir, and Rust, ranked in order from most to least experienced.In a nutshell, I'm all about breaking down complex tech stuff, building cool things, and having some fun along the way!"

                            My journey started after I completed my 12th, since I had to move abroad for my bachelor &apos;s degree, but I had 6 months. I started learning about tech, and found this field exhilarating. I wanted a more structured path and did some research and found CS50 by Harvard. There, I learned a bunch of new things, C, SQL, DSA, React, JavaScript, and built my first website. I parallelly opted for a course in Python by Angela Yu on Udemy. After completing these courses, I got to know how web development works in general. I built some servers in Flask. On January 1, 2023, I decided I should do DSA since it &apos;s an important part of technical interviews. I followed YouTube videos by Kunal Kushwaha and Striver, learned Java, and started solving questions on LeetCode. I did this for about 2-3 months consistently, solved around 200-220 questions, then I thought that &apos; s good enough, and I am not going to give interviews now since I don &apos; t have a degree. So, I thought it &apos; s better I should improve my development skills and learn Web Development. I like to try new things, so I started doing Web3 because one of my friends was doing it. Simultaneously, I started learning about cloud and machine learning. I did this for a month or so, built a project in web3 - a website to create web tokens, and in machine learning, I was just brushing up my math. During this time, I tried vim and dual booted my Windows to Ubuntu (the best decision I made). I took that step after watching a video by Harkirat. Fast forward, I learned DevOps, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, and Ansible. So, in the first year of my programming, I have touched on all domains of tech I find interesting. The mistake I made was that I generally opted for courses or YouTube videos. Now, I have decided I will go deeper into web development, and these days, since Next.js is quite popular, I am making projects in Next.js and trying to learn all the latest tech. I am also learning Golang.
