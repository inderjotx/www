                            Hi there üëãüèª I &apos; m Inderjot, a {getAge()}-year-old guy, passionate about computers.
                        </p>

                            I started my journey in October 2022 after completing my 12th grade. I joined a course on Udemy and started learning Python. Since then, I have been developing stuff, from websites, games to web3 tokens. At one point in time, I went very deep into DevOps and cloud, learned Kubernetes and Docker. But I found building products more satisfying for me than setting up servers and infrastructure.
                            So, now I&apos;m fully focused on web development. Lately, I have joined a startup as a founding member, and my prime focus is to build a robust backend to handle scale and performance. Apart from this, I am also freelancing and building my own products.
